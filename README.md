Due to the size limitation of the files, the testing users need to download the GNSS datasets from the reference station network by themselves to run the "ReadOBS" and "ExtractMCB" scripts.
The testing users can directly run the "EstimateCOSB" and "AnalyzeCOSB" scripts based on the extracted MCBs and generated SINEX files in the "MCB" and "5_FilesAnalysis" folders.
